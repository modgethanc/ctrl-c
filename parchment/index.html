<p>parchment is a web-based intepreter for interactive fiction games!</p>
<p>it's easy to make your own games run as a standalone page, so you can share your games as just a link to a website, rather than a file that has to be downloaded and run in seperate interpreter. it'll even work on some mobile browsers.</p>
<p>the game engine runs in javascript, and you can read many more details about it at <a href="https://code.google.com/p/parchment/">the official website</a>.</p>
<h3>HOW TO IMPLEMENT</h3>
<p>see my <a href="../parchmentsample.html">sample page</a> for a demonstration.</p>
<p><b>bare minimum:</b> just copy that file to your own directory, and replace the 'default_story' value with the location of your game file.</p>
<p><b>other options:</b> change the page title, and think about whether or not you want to put any info in the sidebar. i tend to use the sidebar to list basic commands as a guide for new players, interesting new verbs, links to maps or other resources, release information, etc. if you don't want any of that, just remove the sidebar div.</p>
<p><b>note!</b> if you include any links in the sidebar (or otherwise), include target="_blank" in the &lt;a&gt; tag, or else that link will load in the same page as the game is running, and ruin your player's game.</p>
<p><b>advanced options</b> you can grab the css file referenced and copy it to your own directory, and make your own page styling!</p>
<p>feel free to ask me if you have any questions with getting parchment working, or for general interactive fiction advice/playthrough/troubleshooting, etc.</p>
